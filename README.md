# restaurant-website-project
This is a MERN stack project.
React.js is used for creating frontend. The frontend app has dynamic webpages linked with react-router. The core concepts of react like react hooks like useState, useEffect, useParams, useLocation etc, props, and custom components were used. There are several pages like home, login, reviews, add-edit reviews. 
Backend of the web application is created using Node.Js and Express.Js framework. Different routes were routed and data is accesed from database and served to the front end by backend code. Used MongoDB Atlas as cloud database. Implemented full-text Atlas search to seamlessly search through the data with any type of query
Restaurants can be searched and selected to view their details and reviews. When logged in, reviews can be created, modified or deleted by the respective user
Deployed the webapp on Render: Cloud Application Hosting Platform to get it live and running on the internet after integration URL: https://bhanuteja-restaurant-project.onrender.com/
